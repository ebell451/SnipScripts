    Cloud Shell runs on a temporary host provided on a per-session, per-user basis
    Cloud Shell times out after 20 minutes without interactive activity
    Cloud Shell requires an Azure file share to be mounted
    Cloud Shell uses the same Azure file share for both Bash and PowerShell
    Cloud Shell is assigned one machine per user account
    Bash persists $Home using a 5-GB image held in your file share
    The machine hosting Cloud Shell is free, with a pre-requisite of a mounted Azure Files share. Regular storage costs apply.
